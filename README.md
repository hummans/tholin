Tholin - the cross platform privacy and security focused Stellar app.  
  
## Why Tholin?
  
I wanted an app where I could send money to my family back home in India speedily, reliably and cheaply. Sure, there's Moneygram but it's not convenient enough and sometimes not as speedy enough. It's certainly not cost-effective too.

Tholin fills that gap. Tholin is primarily for people who are living in low-income and impoverished areas and want to send/receive money easily. I'd also want Tholin to have a business version so that businesses in places like India can get money transferred fast - we know what the situation is like for vendors over there and in many other countries too where cash isn't king. 

Stellar is perfect for this. 

## Features of Tholin
Tholin must have the following features for it to work:
* Accessible on both Android and iOS.
* Accessible in a wide variety of areas.
* Easy for users to use and grok the terminology.
* Open-source.
* Low cost for transfers, preferably free.
* Very secure as it will hold users funds.
* NFC transfers of funds.
* Inflation capabilities.
* Multi-sig.

## Current progress
Main mockup pages done on Android and iOS and the database schema for a multi-account architecture (think family bank account).
